    <h1>Chess</h1>
    <p>Chess is can be a relatively difficult game in terms of using strategy and logic. It is fun because there are so many moves that can be calculated. It is a two player game where each player is given the same amount of pieces with specific moving options. For example: a player's king can move one square in any direction, while a bishop can only move diagonally. When a player's pawn takes over the other player's piece at the same position, the player that took over the position removes their opponent's piece from the board. The more pieces a player looses the harder it is for them to win. A player wins by capturing their opponents king. Chess is a very old game that is still exciting to play today!</p>
