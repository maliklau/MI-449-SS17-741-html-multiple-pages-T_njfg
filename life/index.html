    <h1>The Game of LIFE</h1>
    <p>This game is really fun, and multiple people can play at one time. Each player is given a play piece, in this game it is a car, in which they will travel around the board after spinning a dial. The players move as many spaces as the number that they spun. When a player lands on a sqaure, they may have to pick up "life" tiles or choose a card depicting a life event such as buying a house. The game is really fun becuase you never know which "path in life" you are going to get delt.</p>
