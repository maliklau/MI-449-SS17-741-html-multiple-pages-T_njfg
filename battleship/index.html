    <h1>Battleship</h1>
    <p>Battleship is a fun, but simple game. It is a two person game in which opponents try to "sink" the other players ships. A location grid is given to each player and colored pegs to fill in previously selected positions. When a position is hit where a player has a ship the player inserts a red peg into that position, when a ship is not hit a white peg is used. Once a player's entire ship's peg holes have been filled with red pegs they must announce the type of ship that has been hit. Once all of a player's ships have been sunk, that player looses. During the game opponents can not see the other's ship locations.</p>
